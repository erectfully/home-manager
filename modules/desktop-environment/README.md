# Desktop Environment Module

Collection of configurations related to desktop environment, for now I was experimenting with `hyprland` a some time ago but as `wayland` is pain in the ass for most of the usecases in professional environment I've decided to switch back into GNOME. Thus, this module will most likely hold two configurations (or more) for different desktop environments.
